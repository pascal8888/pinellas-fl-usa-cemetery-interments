# Pinellas-FL-USA-Cemetery-Interments
*A project to transform multiple disparate data collections about cemetary interments into a clean tidy data set optimized for analyzing geneological data.*
## Experimental Design
The Pinellas Genealogical Society (PGS) has a set of text-based lists of interments of cemeteries in Pinellas county.  [They can be accessed here:](http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~flpgs/pgs-cemetery-indexes.htm).
The structure of each of the tables is not 100% consistent accross the lists.
